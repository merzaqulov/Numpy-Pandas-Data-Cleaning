# Numpy-Pandas-Data-Cleaning
"My Cleaning Project" focuses on cleaning and merging three datasets: only_wood_customer_us_1.csv, only_wood_customer_us_2.csv, and only_wood_customer_us_3.csv. The project corrects inconsistencies in fields like Gender, Name, Age, Email, and City, standardizes formats, and addresses missing values. The cleaned datasets are merged into a single, structured dataset, ready for reliable analysis or use.
